Since then, we have been an essential part of the identity of Roquetes, organizing annual celebrations that combine tradition, culture, and participation. Over the years, more than a hundred people have contributed with their effort and passion to consolidate this entity as one of the festive pillars of the municipality. Today, with more than five decades of history, we continue to grow with the same spirit with which we began: making each festival a reflection of the soul of Roquetes.",

We are motivated by seeing children, young people, and adults experience with excitement each event, each tradition, and each gathering. We work with enthusiasm to offer inclusive, creative proposals with a sense of community. Our motivation is clear: continue building, through festivals, a lively, united Roquetes that is proud of its culture.",
